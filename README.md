<h2 align="left">Who am I ?</h2>

I am an Android Developer who has been in the Android community for three years, constantly improving himself and aiming for specialization.

<br/>

üßë‚Äçüîß How do I keep myself up to date ?

- [Android Jetpack Compose][0] : This UI toolkit allows me to create UI with less code and faster.
- [Android Development][1] : This documents I learned many code functions, including how to create a user interface using XML.
- [Architectural Patterns][2] : I start by getting to know the architectures I want to learn on wikipedia.
- [Kotlin][3] : I sometimes refresh my knowledge by following the updates to Kotlin here.
 - Youtube Channels
     - [Stefan Jovanovic][4] : I follow detailed examples about Jetpack compose on this youtube channel.
     - [Philipp Lackner][5] : I follow details about Android components and architectures on this channel.
     - [Kekod][6] : I follow the Kotlin documentation and the trainings held every year and get examples.

<br/>

üì∞ Where do I follow the news ?

- [Android Headlines][7]
- [Android Authority][8]
- [Android Centeral][9]
- [Android Police][10]
- [XDA][11]

<br/>

üß† What libraries do I know ?

- REMOTE
   - [Retrofit][12] : I use this library to create an HTTP client on an Android device.
   - [Apollo][13] : I use this library to define and process GraphQL queries.
   - [Firebase][14] : I use it to create and manage users along with cloud database, application crashing and analyzing process.
- LOCAL
   - [Datastore][15] : I use it to permanently save small data, usually in the form of keys and values, and to read them on the fly.
   - [Room][16] : I use it for local server purposes to save and read a set of tabular data.
- Dependency Injection ( DI )
   - [Koin][17] : This library is the dependency injection I've been using a lot lately because of its simplicity compared to Hilt.
   - [Hilt][18] : It is my Dagger based dependency injection library that I can't do without even though it was difficult at first.
- Asynchronous
   - [Kotlin Coroutines][19] : A library that allows me to run three scopes and dispatchers with suspend functions asynchronously.
- Data Stream
   - [Kotlin Flow][20] : It is my asynchronous data streaming library, but it is more flexible than Livedata.
   - [Livedata][21] : I use it for a data flow structure that is sensitive to activity and part lifecycle, but I generally prefer flow.
- Picture
   - [Picasso][22] : It is the first image upload library I met that is older and slightly less efficient than Glide and Coil.
   - [Glide][23] : This library is more performance than the picasso, but slightly more complex.
   - [Coil][24] : This library is new, but it has jetpack compose support and includes all the positive features of picasso and glide.
- Animation
   - [Lottie][25] : It is my library that allows me to animate with raw files.
